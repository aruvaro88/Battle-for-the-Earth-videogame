# Battle for the Earth

Battle for the Earth is a videogame programed in JavaScript. It has some HTML & CSS coding in order to do a friendly UI. 

## A videogame?

This is my first programing project during Ironhack bootcamp in Madrid. This project consist in program a videogame from scratch. I love arcades, and thats why I choose to imitate arcade shooters.


## Instructions
Player controls are quite easy. They are describe on main title screen:
```bash
Arrow keys -> move your spaceship
Spacebar -> shoot
```

## Enemies
Battle for the Earth have four enemies with different moves and shooting styles each. You can apreciate they have different sizes. 
Their spawn is controlled by probability.

## Power-Ups
There are three different Power-Ups, with different effects over player.
```bash
+1 shooting impact
+1 ship shooting
+1 life
```

## Contributing
I design four different enemies and a final boss. Battle for the Earth also have three different power ups to make game easier. I consider that my game have much more things to improve, feel free to clone this game and design your own features.

## Feedback
This is my first programming project, I want to know your opinion about my game, so if you want to leave some feedback about it, I will apreciate it.
